# @atomist/microgrammar

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40atomist%2Fmicrogrammar.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40atomist%2Fmicrogrammar)

Parsing library written in [TypeScript][ts], filling the large gap
between the sweet spots of regular expressions and full-blown
[BNF][bnf] or equivalent grammars.  It can parse and cleanly update
structured content.

[ts]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/ (TypeScript)

## Concepts

**Microgrammars** are a powerful way of parsing structured content
such as source code, described in this [Stanford paper][mg-paper].
Microgrammars are designed to recognize structures in a string or
stream and extract their content: For example, to recognize a Java
method that has a particular annotation and to extract particular
parameters. They are more powerful and [typically more
readable][regex-hell] than [regular expressions][regex] for complex
cases, although they can be built using regular expressions.

Atomist microgrammars go beyond the Stanford paper example in that
they permit _updating_ as well as matching, preserving positions. They
also draw inspiration from other experience and sources such as the
old [SNOBOL programming language][snobol].

## Examples

There are two styles of use:

-   From definitions: Defining a grammar in JavaScript objects
-   From strings: Defining a grammar in a string that resembles input
    that will be matched

### Definitions style

Here's a simple example:

```typescript
const mg = Microgrammar.fromDefinitions<{name: string, age: number}>({
    name: /[a-zA-Z0-9]+/,
    _col: ":",
    age: Integer
});

const results = mg.findMatches("-celine:61 greg*^ tom::: mandy:11");
assert(result.length === 2);
const first = results[0];
assert(first.$matched === "celine:61");
// The offset of this match was the 1st character, as the 0th was discarded
assert(first.$offset === 1);
assert(first.name === "celine");
assert(first.age === 61);
```

Some notes:

-   A microgrammar definition is typically an object literal, with its
    properties being matched in turn. This is like **concatenation**
    in a BNF grammar.
-   Matcher property values can be regular expressions (like
    `/[a-zA-Z0-9]+/` here), string literals (like `:`), or custom
    matchers (like `Integer`). It's easy to define custom matchers for
    use in composition.
-   All properties need to match for the whole microgrammar to match.
-   Properties that match are bound to the result, unless their names begin with `_`, in which
    case the values are discarded.
-   Certain out of band values, beginning with `$`, are added to the
    results, showing the exact text that matched, the offset etc.
-   When using TypeScript, microgrammar returns can be strongly typed. In this case we've
    used an anonymous type, but we could also use an interface. We
    could also use untyped, JavaScript style.
-   Matching skips junk such as `greg*^ tom:::`. In this case, `greg`
    and `tom:` will look like the start of valid matches, but the
    first will fail when it can't match a `:` and the second when
    there isn't a digit after the colon.
-   We can match against a string or a stream. In this case we've used
    a string. In stream matching, we'd be more likely to use one an
    API offering callbacks rather than building an array, so we don't
    need to hold all our matches in memory at once.

Of course, such a simple example could easily be handled by a regular
expression and capture groups. But the power becomes apparent with
nested productions and more elaborate matchers.

A more complex example, showing composition:

```typescript
export const CLASS_NAME = /[a-zA-Z_$][a-zA-Z0-9_$]+/;

// Any annotation we're not interested in
const DiscardedAnnotation = {
    _at: "@",
    _annotationName: CLASS_NAME,
    _content: optional(JavaParenthesizedExpression),
};

const SpringBootApp = Microgrammar.fromDefinitions<{ name: string }>({
    _app: "@SpringBootApplication",
    _content: optional(JavaParenthesizedExpression),
    _otherAnnotations: zeroOrMore(DiscardedAnnotation),
    _visibility: optional("public"),
    _class: "class",
    name: CLASS_NAME,
});
```

This will match content like this:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@Foo
@Bar(name = "Baz", magicParam = 31754)
public class MySpringBootApplication
```

Notes:

-   `JavaParenthesizedExpression` is a built-in matcher constant that
    matches any valid Java content within `(...)`. It uses a state
    machine. It's easy to write such custom matchers.
-   By default, microgrammars are tolerant of whitespace, treating it
    as a token separator. This is the behavior we want when parsing
    most languages or configuration formats.
-   Because the other properties have names beginning with `_`, only
    the class name (`MySpringBootApplication` in our example) is bound
    to the result. We care about the structure of the rest of the
    class declaration, but we don't need to extract other values in
    this particular case.

### String style

This is a higher level usage model in which a string resembling the
desired input but with variable placeholders is used to define the
grammar.

This style is ideally suited for simpler grammars. For example:

```typescript
const ValuePredicateGrammar = Microgrammar.fromString<Predicate>(
    "@${name}='${value}'");
```

It can be combined with the definitional style through providing
optional definitions for the named fields. For example, to constrain
the match on a name in the above example using a regular expression:

```typescript
const ValuePredicateGrammar = Microgrammar.fromString<Predicate>(
    "@${name}='${value}'", {
    	name: /[a-z]+/
    });
```

As with the object definitional style, whitespace is ignored by default.

Further documentation can be found in the
[reference](docs/reference.md).  You can also take a look at the tests
in this repository.

## Alternatives and when to use microgrammars

Microgrammars have obvious similarities to [BNF grammars][bnf], but
differ in some important respects:

-   They are intended to match and explain _parts_ of the input, rather
    than the whole input
-   They excel at skipping content they are uninterested in
-   They are not necessarily context free
-   They do not need to construct a full AST, although they construct
    ASTs for structures they do match. Thus they can easily cope with
    partially structured data, happily skipping over incomprehensible content

[bnf]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus–Naur_form (Backus–Naur Form)

Similarities are:

-   The idea of **productions**
-   Composability, including the ability to reuse productions in
    different grammars
-   Operations such as _alternative_, _optional_ and _rep_, that
    enable building complex structures.

Compared to regular expressions, microgrammars are:

-   Capable of handing greater complexity
-   More composable
-   Higher level, able to use regular expressions as building blocks
-   Capable of expressing nested structures
-   Arbitrarily extensible through TypeScript function predicates and
    custom **matchers**

While it would be overkill to use a microgrammar for something that
can be expressed in a simple regex, microgrammars tend to be clearer
for complex cases.
